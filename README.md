A web-based application for adding and removing watermarks from videos. This project allows users to upload a video, overlay a watermark image, adjust the watermark’s position and size, and download the watermarked video.

Features
Video Upload: Easily upload a video file to apply watermarks.
Watermark Upload: Supports PNG, JPEG, and GIF images for watermarks.
Interactive Watermark Placement: Drag and resize the watermark to position it on the video as needed.
Responsive Design: Works across different screen sizes.
Download Processed Video: Smooth, efficient downloading after processing.
Limitations
This project is a basic watermarking tool and is not meant for heavy video editing. Video processing is handled on the client side or via a backend service for smaller projects.


Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
GitHub Pages: You can deploy the application directly on GitHub Pages for frontend-only functionality.
Backend (Optional): To use video processing on the backend (like applying watermarks with FFmpeg), deploy a backend service.
